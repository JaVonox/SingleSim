# Single Simulator
## Introduction
Dr. Wester is a new transfer to the signals department of an intergalactic dating company - specialising in finding life across the galaxy and, more importantly, setting it up on hot dates with other alien lifeforms.
Previously the prestigious head of frontend development, Dr. Wester has undergone an emergency transfer to the signals department for unknown reasons - foregoing his comfortable high-pay office job for the lowest position in the company.

Single Simulator is intended to be a parody of other "Signal Sim"-esque games (Most notably the genres namesake, 'Signal Simulator' , as well as spiritual successor 'Voices Of The Void')  - inwhich players search for alien life among the stars.
This is intended to be a far more relaxed experience, while still maintaining the atmosphere of the aforementioned games.
